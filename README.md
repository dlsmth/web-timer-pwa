# Web Timer PWA

I enjoy listening to radio stations from all around the world, or even just locally. I like to work to it, fall asleep to it, walk to it, or just start a stream and walk away from my phone or computer. While some streaming stations have apps that contains timers, most don't. I also don't like having to download an app just to stream from a website. But I love having an auto-shutoff feature.

Originally built as a native iOS app, I found it to be so useful I later built it as a PWA. On launch, the user can enter a web address or choose from a list of their five most recently used web addresses. The user can then use the picker to choose a time and tap the start button, or can just tap one of three start presets. The website opens in a modal where the stream can be started. The modal will close when the countdown timer runs out (shown in upper right), or can be ended early using the close button. It's quite simple from a user experience, and effective as an MVP. That said, this was just my first approach, and there are probably side effects that should be addressed (memory leakage, etc), so I'll look at addtional approaches if I find the time. It also includes a dark mode, for night-time use.

This was a pretty quick build, and fairly simple for start to finish. (Design & development took about a weekend.) It's working as expected, and I do use it quite a bit. That said, the more I use it, the more I'm seeing ways in which the UX/UI can be improved, and I'm also seeing a few additional features that can be added.
